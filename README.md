# WXT + Svelte

This template should help get you started developing with Svelte in WXT.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Svelte](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode).

## Gotchas
We have to use hardcoded sizes because the sizes of the website on which the DisplayEntry.svelte and AddToDictionary.svelte
elements are displayed spew into the components and affect the styling a lot and the only way I know of
for now to resolve that is through hard coded styles. Youtube is a notorious example of such a website.

This explains for example, the fact that we set `h-[40px]` on buttons instead of relying on the semantic styles
auto generated by daysi UI.
